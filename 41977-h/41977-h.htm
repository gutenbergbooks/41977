<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> little cousins of Hindustan are charming
little people, even though their manners and
customs and their religion are so very different
from our own.</p>

<p>India is a big country, and there are many
different races of people living within its borders,
the two principal ones being the Mohammedans
and the Hindus. The Mohammedans
number about sixty millions and there are about
a hundred and eighty millions of Hindus, who
are by far the superior race.</p>

<p>The intelligence of the Hindus is of a very
high order, but, like all Eastern races, they have
many superstitions. Their attention to their
food and drink and personal cleanliness is remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and, though their customs in this respect
are peculiar, they follow a healthful and
sanitary manner of living which might well be
practised by Western folk.</p>

<p>The arts and crafts of the Hindus and their
trades and professions are very strange and interesting,
and the young people themselves
invariably grow up in the same occupations as
their elders. There is no mixing of the races
or <i>castes</i>, and members of one caste always associate
with those of the same class.</p>

<p>But the English influence is making itself
so strongly felt, that frequently the children
learn English as early in life as they do their
own language; so our little American cousins
would almost always be able to make of them
good playfellows and would perhaps be able to
learn many valuable lessons from Our Little
Hindu Cousins.</p>

<h2>Our Little Hindu Cousin</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHOLA AT HOME</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was barely light when little Chola rolled
out of his blanket and gave his cousin Mahala
a shake as he lay stretched out beside him.</p>

<p>"Lazy one, listen! I hear little kids bleating
below in the courtyard; the new goats
with the long hair must have come. Hasten!
We will be the first to see them!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mahala, sitting up and rubbing
his eyes, "thou art the plague of my life.
I was in the midst of a beautiful dream. I
dreamed that I was sitting beside a clear
stream, with many dishes of sweetmeats beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
me, and I was just beginning to eat them when
thou didst wake me."</p>

<p>"Oh, thou greedy one! 'Tis always of
sweets that thou art thinking," laughed Chola,
as he and Mahala ran down the little winding
stairway which led from their room into the
courtyard.</p>

<p>"Here they are, aren't they dear little creatures?"
cried Chola, as two little kids came
frisking toward them, while the big white
mother goat followed them bleating piteously.</p>

<p>"What fine long white hair they have," exclaimed
Mahala, trying to catch one of the
kids as it bounded past him.</p>

<p>"A lot of fuss over some goats," grumbled
the old porter. "This fellow with his goats
came hammering before cock-crow at the gate,"
continued the old man, who did not like having
to come down from his little room over the
big gateway of the court at such an early hour
to open the gate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are early risers in the hills," said the
man who had brought the goats. "It is you
town folks who are lazy; but I promised your
master when he bought the goats in the
market yesterday that he should have them
this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, thou art from the hills," exclaimed
the boys, looking curiously at the little man
in his strange dress.</p>

<p>"Yes, from the far northwest; and both I
and my goats are homesick for the tall mountains
with the snow on their tops and the great
pine-trees. We like not these hot plains; but
I must be off to the market," and, twirling his
stick, the little man left, clanging the heavy
gate behind him.</p>

<p>"Come, we will bathe before our fathers
come down," said Mahala, after they had
played about with the kids awhile; "they always
say we are in their way." So saying the
two little boys ran into the big garden where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
under a group of mango-trees, there was a big
stone tank, or pond, of water, with steps going
down into it. Here Chola and Mahala bathed
every morning, for it was part of their religion
and must be done in a certain way. Indeed,
some of our little Hindu cousins bathe before
each meal; and this is why, all over India,
you will see the people bathing in the rivers,
in the public bathing-places, and in their own
gardens at all times of the day. Moreover, it
is a very pleasant custom for a hot country
like India. As the boys were splashing merrily
about in the big tank, down dropped a big
mango right on top of Chola's head.</p>

<p>"Where did that come from?" he cried,
looking around; but there was no one to be
seen, so he went on splashing, when down came
another mango, and a sound was heard as if
some one was chuckling to himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's thou, son of mischief!" cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Chola, as a little monkey leaped down and
capered around on the edge of the tank.</p>

<p>It was Jam, Chola's pet monkey. A cousin
of the gardener had caught it in his field one
night when he was guarding his crops from the
monkeys. These mischievous animals would
often dash out in droves from the near-by
forest at night and eat up the farmers' crop.
He did not wish to kill the little monkey; for,
like many Hindus, he thought it a sacred animal.
So he had brought it to Chola for a
pet.</p>

<p>The boys had great fun with Jam, though
often he would play mischievous pranks on
them. To-day Jam thought this was just his
chance to have fun. Spying Chola's turban
lying beside his clothes on the steps of the
tank, he pounced upon it and carried it up into
the mango-tree.</p>

<p>"Oh, son of mischief, just wait until I catch
thee! Bring back my turban!" cried Chola,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
as he scrambled out of the water and climbed
up after Jam in a jiffy. It would never do for
him to lose his turban, for it would be very
bad manners for him to be seen without this
curious head-covering. But as Chola went up
the tree, Jam climbed down by an out-stretching
limb and swung himself to the ground,
then away he went tearing around the garden
with Chola after him. Suddenly Jam tossed
the turban over the garden wall and flew to
the top of the house, wild with joy at having
given Chola such a chase.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mahala, find it for me," said Chola,
as he dropped breathless on the grass.</p>

<p>Mahala ran out into the road and was back
directly.</p>

<p>"Here is thy turban all unrolled," he
laughed, throwing what seemed to be many
yards of white cloth at Chola.</p>

<p>"Just wait until I take a good bamboo
stick to thee, wicked one," said Chola, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
his fist at Jam, now safe out of reach, and
beginning to wind the cloth around his head.</p>

<p>After their bath it did not take the boys
long to dress, for they just wound a long white
garment around and around them, and slipped
over this a little jacket.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the cook-room now and see
what the women are cooking; to dream of
sweets does not take away one's hunger," said
Mahala, after the boys had given their teeth
a vigorous washing and rubbing with little
sticks, which was another one of their religious
duties.</p>

<p>As the boys ran across the courtyard, scattering
the goats, doves, and fowls which were
picking up seeds and grain, a voice called out:
"Give me food, oh, little princelings!"</p>

<p>"That must be a beggar, but I do not see
him," said Mahala, looking around.</p>

<p>"It is old green-coat," said Chola, laughing,
and pointing to the other side of the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
where hung a hoop in which sat a beautiful
parrot, all brilliant green and blue and red.
He could talk so well that a stranger who came
to the house would look everywhere to find the
human being who he thought had spoken to
him. Once there came a thief who thought
he could steal the fine cock that stood under
the veranda with his head under his wing.
Just as the thief caught the cock by the neck,
such a torrent of abuse came from above that
he dropped the cock and rolled in the dust,
crying out: "Mercy! mercy! Oh, great one,
thy slave will never do this thing again!"
Then as he heard a laugh, and no one seized
him, he fearfully lifted his head, and there sat
the parrot swinging on his hoop-perch. The
thief slunk away very much ashamed that he
had been fooled by a bird.</p>

<p>"Ah, it smells good!" said Mahala, as
they looked in at the door of the cook-house
which was near the great gateway.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no stoves or even fireplaces in
the cook-room, but a series of little holes or
cupboards in the wall, in each of which was
a pot or pan resting on a few bricks or stones
over a tiny fire. These little ovens were near
the floor, so that the cook could watch the pots
and pans while squatting. No Hindu stands
up to any kind of work if he has a chance to
sit down.</p>

<p>Three or four women were squatting around
watching the cooking, while the boys' old
grandmother bustled about scolding everybody
within sight.</p>

<p>"Do not linger here," said the grandmother
to the boys, "this is no place for children."</p>

<p>"But, grandmother, Shriya is here," objected
Mahala; "why can't we stay, too."</p>

<p>"I am helping grandmother," said Mahala's
little sister Shriya, who, with a very important
air, was sitting on the floor stirring
something in a big bowl. Shriya felt that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was a person of importance these days, for
was she not going to be married soon!</p>

<p>"Shriya is a useful little girl; besides, why
are you not in the great room where thy fathers
make sacrifice to the Gods of the Household?"
answered the old lady, rather tartly.
Like all good cooks she did not like to be bothered
while she was preparing her dishes.</p>

<p>"Come away, the grandmother is always
cross when she is in the cook-room," whispered
Chola; so he and Mahala crossed the
court again and went into the house.</p>

<p>If you should come to visit Chola, you
would think no one lived there when you first
entered the house. You would see no furniture
of any kind, no tables or chairs, for every
one sits cross-legged on mats or rugs spread
on the floor, or squats on their heels. The
walls are whitewashed and bare, and there are
no pictures or knick-knacks such as you have
at home.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The great-room was the sitting-room and
dining-room for all the family except the
women, who lived in their own part of the
house, called the <i>zenana</i>.</p>

<p>At one end of the great-room was a shrine,
in which was a curious old idol of baked red
clay. This was supposed to be the image of
the family god, and each morning offerings
were made to it. This morning when the boys
came in, they found that the offerings of dishes
of rice and wreaths of flowers had already
been placed around the old idol.</p>

<p>"Thou art late," called out Chola's father,
who was sitting on the wide veranda in front
of the great-room, smoking his big pipe called
a <i>hookah</i>. It was very comfortable on the
veranda, for all around it hung mats of woven
grass to keep off the burning sun and yet let
in a cooling breeze. You must know that
India is a very hot country and that the people
make use of all sorts of things to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
them comfortable. That is why the houses
all have broad verandas, where the folk can
sit and keep much cooler than within doors.</p>

<p>"It was all Jam's fault," said Chola, and
he sat beside his father and told of the trick
the little monkey had played him, which
amused his father very much.</p>

<p>"You have spoilt Jam," he said. "Some
day he will have to be sent back to the forest
if he does not behave himself better."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the steaming dishes of food
were being brought from the cook-house and
placed on the big mat in the centre of the
great-room; this kept the grandmother and
the boys' mothers busy, for they had to serve
three separate repasts, one for the men, one
for the children, and then, last of all, one for
themselves. All this took a long time, for
there was Harajar Chumjeree, Chola's father,
and his wife Lalla, and Murree Rao, Chola's
uncle, and his wife, and his son Mahala, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Mahala's little sister Shriya, and the grandmother,
and several cousins and cousins' widows.
They all lived in the big stone house,
built around a square courtyard, which stood
in the middle of a large garden on the outskirts
of the beautiful city of Lucknow.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother, give us the fine white
rice this morning with the beautiful curry
which thou hast made! None other tastes
so good as thine," said Chola, coaxingly, as
he and his little cousins seated themselves on
the cleanly swept earthen floor of the great-room.</p>

<p>"Aha! art thou young rajahs that you
should eat the beautiful rice of the feast-days?"
said the old lady, as she bustled back
to the cook-room; for the very fine rice is
costly, and not usually given to children every
time they ask for it. Nevertheless, the old
lady was always pleased when they praised her
curries, and, like other grandmothers the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
over, she quite spoiled her little grandsons.
So, presently, she came back with a big bowl
of the fine white rice and put a pile of it on
each child's plate, taking care not to actually
touch the plates themselves, and then she made
a hole, or basin, in the centre of each pile and
filled it with a steaming hot curry. This is
one of the dishes that the children were fondest
of and there are many ways of preparing it.</p>

<p>This curry of the grandmother's was made
of several kinds of vegetables, and was very
hot and spicy indeed, but the children enjoyed
it. After this they had flat cakes of fried
meal, and then a preserve of fruit.</p>

<p>"Here is milk from the new goats," said
the grandmother, placing a big bowl of goat's
milk before each child; "but hasten, little
ones, for I and the mother and Shriya go with
my son to the Bazaar to-day. There are many
things to buy for the wedding of my granddaughter,"
continued the old lady, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
devoted to her grandchildren and really ruled
the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, take me, too," cried Chola. "There
are no lessons at the school; for thou knowest
it is a holiday, and Mahala goes with his
father to visit a cousin. I will be all alone."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A DAY IN THE BAZAAR</div>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> it was settled that Chola should go, too.
A little later the "<i>ekka ghurrie</i>" was ready
in the courtyard, and they all stowed themselves
away in it somehow. The "<i>ekka ghurrie</i>"
is a funny kind of carriage made of bamboo
poles hung between two high wheels, with
a red canopy to keep off the sun. It was
drawn by a little pony, and the shafts were
fastened to a stout bamboo stick across his
high pointed collar.</p>

<p>They found themselves rather a tight fit,
for the "<i>ekka</i>" was small; and the <i>coolie</i>,
or servant, who was driving had to balance
himself as best he could on one of the shafts.
Nobody minded this, however, and away went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the little pony along the dusty road, past gardens
and many low, rambling two-storied
houses very much like their own.</p>

<p>Everything looked wonderfully bright and
gay. Many of the houses were painted a brilliant
pink or yellow with bright green verandas;
and the people, too, were dressed so
gaily in all kinds of colours, though some of
them wore pure white, which looked nice and
cool in the blazing sun.</p>

<p>Soon they passed the great gate of the city
and came into the busy streets of the Bazaar.</p>

<p>In all Eastern cities there is a part called
the Bazaar, where are all the shops; and in a
large city like Lucknow the Bazaar is made
up of many streets of nothing but shops.</p>

<p>All the fruit and vegetable shops are in a
street to themselves; all the workers in brass
and other metals in another. You will find the
silk merchants in one street; and, in still another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
all the shops that sell cotton goods,&mdash;the
pretty flowered kinds stamped with tinsel
as well as plain white, for every one in India
wears light cotton or silk clothes.</p>

<p>When they came to the street where the silk
merchants were, the grandmother and Shriya
and her mother got out; for it was here they
were going to buy Shriya's pretty silk dresses
and long veils, and other pretty things.</p>

<p>"I would rather go with thee, father," said
Chola, so he and his father turned into another
street. Here were the shops where wonderful
gold and silver work was made and
sold; and where precious stones were set into
all kinds of rich and curious jewelry. The
shop of Chola's father was one of the largest
in the street, though we would think it very
small. It was more like a big cupboard in
the side of the street than anything else; and
he could reach nearly everything in it without
getting up from his seat. The shop had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
name or sign over it, nor were there any windows,
while no doors were needed because the
entire front was open to the street, so that
customers could look in to see if there was
anything they wished to buy without coming
inside.</p>

<p>Chola sat on his heels watching his father
as he sat cross-legged on a carpet spread on
the floor, putting a beautiful blue turquoise
into the setting of a silver necklace. Near to
his elbow was a low table on which were piles
of precious stones. He liked to come with his
father to the Bazaar and watch him make the
gold and silver into beautiful things. When
Chola was older he would come every day
to the Bazaar, and his father would teach him
to be a silversmith like himself. Every little
Hindu boy follows the same trade as his
father.</p>

<p>The Hindus love jewelry of all kinds, and
both men and women wear quantities of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
In fact much of their wealth is often put into
the form of necklaces, rings, and bracelets,
which the women wear all the time. The Hindus
think this is the safest way to keep their
wealth. So you see why the jewellers do such
a big trade in India.</p>

<p>"Father, there's a customer," whispered
Chola, but Harajar paid not the slightest attention
to a tall man in a long silk robe, with
a big turban on his head, who stopped to look
in the shop. A Hindu merchant usually thinks
it beneath his dignity to ask any one to buy
his wares.</p>

<p>Presently the tall man said: "Are you
happy?"</p>

<p>"I am happy," answered Harajar.</p>

<p>This is the Hindu way of saying "How
do you do?"</p>

<p>Harajar then offered the tall man a seat on
the rug, and his own <i>hookah</i> to smoke, which
is the polite thing to do. The would-be customer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
puffed away at the great pipe for some
minutes, meanwhile saying never a word. Soon
he began to pay compliments; and then he
looked at, and priced, nearly everything in the
shop before he asked the price of the gold-mounted
dagger on which he had had his eye
all the time. Then came the bargaining.</p>

<p>Chola knew that this would take all the
morning, so he slipped away to a shop a little
way down the street, where a big yellow and
red awning hung across the roadway.</p>

<p>Here were beautiful brass ornaments of all
kinds, lamps, vases, pitchers, and what not,
and Chola peered among these for a sight of
his little friend Nao. Only Nao's father was
in sight, and he sat dozing over his <i>hookah</i>.
Farther down the street, however, Chola spied
Nao's embroidered cap bobbing about between
two big camels laden with great bales of
cloth.</p>

<p>Nao as quickly caught sight of his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Chola, and came running up at once. "Oh,
Chola," he cried, as he greeted his little friend
by touching his forehead and the palm of his
right hand, "let us go to where the caravans
gather about the city gate; the man with the
camels has just told me that all the camels
stopped there to rest on entering the city."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Chola, "there are wild, rough
doings among the strange men who come down
from the hills with the camels. I have heard
my father say so."</p>

<p>"Oh, go play with thy sister, then, I will
go alone," said Nao, who made out as if he
would turn away.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid, I, too, will go and talk
with the camel men," Chola answered with
spirit. No little Hindu boy likes to be told
to stay at home with the girls, because in his
country it is a sad fact that little girls are not
thought as much of as boys, nor do they have
so good a time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys slipped away through the
crowded street, dodging between lumbering
wagons drawn by oxen, called buffaloes, and
pushing their way through a crowd of folk
dressed in a great variety of costumes, all in
gay colours and with queer gaudy turbans on
their heads. The turban forms a very important
part of the dress of the Hindu, and Chola
could tell by the colour and shape of each
man's turban to just what <i>caste</i> each man belonged
and what business he was in. There
are many of these <i>castes</i>, or classes, of Hindu
people, and each <i>caste</i> keeps strictly to itself.
A person of one <i>caste</i> must not marry outside
his <i>caste</i>; or touch persons of another <i>caste</i>,
even; or eat with them, or have any friendly
dealings with them. Not only that, but you
would think it very tiresome, would you not,
to have to remember not to sit next to that
person or touch this one? And that you must
find out who cooked your food before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
might eat it? But this is what our little
Hindu cousins have to think of all the time.</p>

<p>Many of the men carried umbrellas of
bright colours. Once only very high and
mighty people in Hindustan carried umbrellas,
or rather had them carried over them by a
servant, but now nearly every one carries one;&mdash;and
they are needed in a country where the
sun shines hotly all the year round. For this
same reason the streets are nearly covered in
by great spreading awnings drawn from one
side to the other and forming a sort of roof.</p>

<p>Just for fun the two boys got in the way of
the "<i>bhisti</i>" or water-carrier, so that the
stream of water from the goatskin bag, with
which he was watering the dusty street, might
play on their bare feet; but when he turned it
toward their heads, they ran away laughing.</p>

<p>"See! there must be a juggler over there,"
said Chola, pointing to a circle of people
around an old man with a gray beard.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The two boys pushed into the circle until
they were near enough to see what wonderful
things the man was doing. He had just put
a few seeds into the dust under a small mat.
"Behold," he cried, "there will grow up a
beautiful flower," and, sure enough, as he
lifted up the mat, there appeared a pot, and
from the pot there began to grow up a stem
and green leaves, until finally it became a tall
plant from which unfolded a great red flower.
All at once, as the juggler held the plant up
for every one to see, the flower changed into
a cage containing two white doves, and, when
the door of the cage was opened, the doves
came out and began to circle about the juggler's
head. At this there was a murmur of
wonder and surprise from the crowd. The
doves entered the cage again; but, as the people
looked, the cage and doves and the red
flower and the plant with the green leaves all
vanished; and the juggler stood on his little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
grass mat with absolutely empty hands. Nothing
could have been hidden about him, for he
had on no clothes except a cloth wrapped
around his waist.</p>

<p>"Is it not wonderful?" whispered Nao.
"There be people who say it is magic; and
that there are no such things in sight as the
flower and the doves, and that it is all the
power of the eye of the old man that makes
other people see things as he wants them to
see them."</p>

<p>"Nay, it is real magic, and the flower did
grow up before us," said Chola. It would
be hard for any one to believe otherwise; for
it is true that the jugglers of India do the most
wonderful tricks, far more wonderful than
those we see in our own country, and no
stranger can really tell how they are done.</p>

<p>"How will you find your camel-man?"
asked Chola, when finally the boys came to
the great square where the caravans camped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Everywhere were camels and horses and men
in strange costumes.</p>

<p>"He said he would be near the great gate,"
said Nao, as he and Chola crept in and around
the big camels and under them, constantly
being scolded by the men for getting in their
way. Finally Nao spied his friend sitting
lazily smoking in the shade of the gateway,
while he watched his camels being unloaded.</p>

<p>"Welcome, oh, little friends," said the big,
bluff fellow. "I suppose it is no use to ask
thee to share my dinner?" he continued, pointing
to the big dish of boiled rice, cabbage, and
goat's meat which one of his stable boys had
just brought him.</p>

<p>The food smelt very good, but Chola and
Nao shook their heads. They knew by the
blue turban and dress of their new friend that
he was a Mohammedan, and they would rather
have starved than eaten food with him; but
they were quite willing to squat beside him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the dust in true Hindu boy fashion, and listen
to his strange tales of the far-away countries
which he had visited, as he ate his meal out
of the big bowl. They heard how he had
come from the great plains of China, across
the snow-covered mountains of the north&mdash;the
great Himalayas, the highest mountains in
the world;&mdash;and how his camels had waded
through snow-drifts up to their necks. He
told them marvellous tales of the great cities
of Delhi and Lahore, with their marble palaces
and beautiful gardens; and of the great
rice-fields of Burma. Sometimes he had crossed
the great desert going toward the west, and
had seen the splendid city of Bombay, and
from there had gone on down the coast where
the tall palm-trees grow. He and his caravan
had crossed India many times, carrying
merchandise from one part of the country to
another. The camel-man talked on until he
had finished eating and was ready for a nap.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be fine fun to ride a camel," said
Nao, as he and Chola made their way back to
the Bazaar.</p>

<p>"I think it is much nicer to ride a big elephant,
as my Uncle Achmed does when he
goes about his lumber yards," answered Chola.
"But, Nao, the smell of thy friend's dinner
has made me hungry. Let us buy some sweetmeats,"
he continued, darting across the street
to a little booth where there were bowls and
baskets filled with all kinds of sweet, sticky
things to eat that not only Hindu children like,
but all the grown-ups as well. When a Hindu
wants a real treat, he eats as many sweetmeats
as he can.</p>

<p>Just as the boys got to the booth, a big bull
buffalo came snorting along. He evidently
wanted sweets, too, for he stuck his head under
the awning of the little shop and took a big
mouthful of preserved fruit from one of the
baskets, at the same time upsetting the contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of another basket over the owner of the little
shop, who was dozing among his wares.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="364" height="550" alt="two children shopping at the bazaar" />
<span class="caption">BUYING SWEETS IN THE BAZAAR.</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, the thief!" cried the man, jumping
up angrily, though he dared not do anything
to the animal; for it was one of the sacred
bulls from a near-by temple. They were
allowed to wander through the streets, though
they often robbed the shops in this mean
fashion.</p>

<p>"'Tis no laughing matter," said the man,
turning to the boys, who could not help laughing
at his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Do not be cross," replied Chola, as he
and Nao helped to pick up the scattered
sweets. "We are a different kind of customer
from the buffalo. How many '<i>cowries</i>'
do you want for this almond paste? Not
too many, mind you," he continued, with an
eye for a bargain, "for we helped you save
the others."</p>

<p>"And eaten some, too, I warrant," grumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the man, still in a bad humour, as he
wrapped up the sweets in a large green leaf
and gave it to Chola, who paid him with some
tiny shells, threaded on a string, which he took
from the wallet he carried in his dress. These
<i>cowrie</i> shells are used for small pieces of money
and are carried on strings. As you may imagine,
each shell is not of a great value.</p>

<p>"Let us eat our sweets here," said Chola,
squatting in the shadow of a wall; and, with
his finger, drawing a circle round them in the
dust. This was intended as a sort of a boundary-line
to keep any <i>low-caste</i> person from
coming too near them while they were eating.
The boys greatly enjoyed their candies, which
they thought all the better for being made with
<i>ghu</i>, a sort of rancid butter.</p>

<p>Just as they were finishing the last bit, some
one came up and touched Nao on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Who comes here to make my food unclean,"
he cried, jumping up angrily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush! It is a little Sahib. Doubtless
he knows no better," said Chola, as he looked
around and saw an English boy standing by.</p>

<p>"I think those things look better than they
taste," the boy said, smiling, as he pointed to
the sweets; "but I meant no harm. I only
wanted to ask if you could tell me where
Colonel Scott lives. I think I have lost my
way."</p>

<p>"Ah, every one knows the Colonel Sahib;
but the house is far from here; in the street
with the great trees near the Chutter Munzil,"
said Chola.</p>

<p>"Where the roofs look like big gold umbrellas,
I know," said the English boy. "My
name is Harry, and Colonel Scott is my father.
My mother and I have just come from England;
but my papa has been here a long time.
While he was buying something in one of the
shops, I followed a man who had a lot of
performing birds; and the first thing I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I had lost my way." Harry rattled away, glad
to find some one to talk to.</p>

<p>Chola could understand him fairly well, for
he had been taught a little English at his
school.</p>

<p>"Yonder stands a '<i>rickshaw</i>.' It will take
you quickly to your home," said Chola, proud
to be able to talk to a little Sahib.</p>

<p>The little Hindu boys hailed the "<i>rickshaw</i>,"
and, nearly bursting with importance,
bargained with the man who pulled it to take
the little Sahib home.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall see you again, for I am
going to live here now," said Harry, as he
thanked the boys and climbed into the "<i>rickshaw</i>,"
which looked like a big perambulator.
Away the man went with it at a lively trot,
with Harry waving his cap in the air as a
good-bye to his new-found friends.</p>

<p>Chola could talk of nothing but the "little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Sahib" as they jogged home in the "<i>ekka</i>"
in the dusk of the evening.</p>

<p>There are many English people in India,
because it is now a part of the British Empire.
So it is not surprising that Chola and Harry
should meet in this way and be able to talk
to each other. Mahala was very much disappointed
because he had not been there, too,
when he heard Chola tell of his adventures as
they ate their supper.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHILDREN'S HOLIDAY</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Chola</span>, art thou there?" said little Nao
the next morning, peeping in between the mats
of the veranda. Nao lived in a pretty pink
house next to Chola's, and their gardens
joined; so he and the two cousins were great
playmates.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm busy," said Chola, without
looking around. The barber had come to
shave his father, and Chola had begged to be
allowed to hold for his father the little looking-glass
which the barber had brought with
him, as he reclined on a rug while the barber
shaved him. The barber made his rounds
from house to house each day, carrying the
tools of his trade with him; and he not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
shaved his patrons' faces, but their heads as
well.</p>

<p>"I only wanted to tell thee that there is
a man just outside the gate with a basket,"
replied Nao, in a tantalizing way; "but if
thou <i>must</i> help the barber&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are plenty of men in the street
with baskets," returned Chola; but he was
beginning to be interested.</p>

<p>"But this man carries a flute," answered
his little friend, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is the snake-charmer!" cried Chola,
jumping up.</p>

<p>"I see thou art tired of playing barber.
Give me the mirror, and thou mayst run away,"
said his father.</p>

<p>Out in the street the boys found the man
dressed all in bright pink, with a basket on
his arm. He had seated himself down in the
shade of a tree, and a crowd of children had
gathered around him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he began to whistle on a little pipe
or flute. "Look," whispered Nao, as a snake's
head pushed up the lid of the basket and crept
slowly out. Then another and another followed,
until several snakes were crawling and
wriggling around in the dust, all keeping time
to the music of the flute. Soon the snakes
began to climb and crawl all over the man,
winding themselves around his neck and arms
to the great delight of the children. Finally
one of the snakes wound itself around the
man's neck; and one around each arm; after
which the man piped them back into their
basket.</p>

<p>Then he spread the handkerchief on the
ground, which was a sign for the children to
pay for the show. This was enough to send
most of the children flying away; for, though
they had enjoyed the performance, many of
them were not willing to pay for it. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Chola and Nao, however, threw some <i>cowrie</i>
shells on the handkerchief before they left.</p>

<p>"May good luck attend thee, my little masters,"
said the snake-charmer with a deep
<i>salaam</i>. Then he picked up his basket again
and went piping down the street to find another
audience.</p>

<p>"Thou hast on thy yellow dress. Hast
thou been to the temple?" asked Nao, as he
and Chola came back into the garden.</p>

<p>"No, I wait for Mahala. Where can he
be?" said Chola, running back into the courtyard.</p>

<p>Mahala was there, busily washing out the
inkstand which he always carried to school,
while Shriya hung out of one of the <i>zenana</i>
windows talking to him.</p>

<p>"I cleaned my inkstand yesterday, oh, tardy
one!" exclaimed Chola.</p>

<p>"Mine, too, is ready," said Mahala, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it a final polish as he spoke. "Now we will
be off."</p>

<p>To-day was the great holiday for the children.
It was the festival of Sarasvati, the
Hindu Goddess of Learning, who is supposed
to be the especial guardian of children.</p>

<p>The boys were going to the temple to lay
their inkstands before the queer image of the
Goddess of Learning, as was the custom on
this holiday festival.</p>

<p>"Thou art not keeping the holiday," called
out Nao, looking up at Shriya.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," answered the little girl, shaking
her head. "I do not want to be a widow
some day; and the grandmother says this is
what would happen if I should read books
and learn to write while I'm little."</p>

<p>The boys laughed; and then ran out to join
the crowd of little boys, who were making
their way toward the temples, all dressed in
bright yellow in honour of the day, some carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their inkstands stuck in their belts, others
swinging them in their hands.</p>

<p>"What shall we do to amuse ourselves?"
asked Mahala, after they had dutifully laid
their inkstands before the queer image of Sarasvati.</p>

<p>"I know," answered Chola. "We will find
the potter and beg a bit of clay from him.
It will be fun to make some toys for ourselves."</p>

<p>The boys turned down a street; and there,
under a big tree on the river-bank, the potter
was at work with piles of damp clay around
him. As usual, a lot of children were gathered
about him. They loved to watch him
take the clay and put it on a revolving wooden
wheel before him and mould dishes and jugs
and bowls of all sorts and shapes. Each
neighbourhood has a potter whose business it
is to make the ware for that village; and he
does a good trade, for it is the custom among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
many of the people to throw away their dishes
after each meal. This of course means that
they must have new ones all the time.</p>

<p>"Eh! well, thou wouldst have clay for thy
toys?" said the gray-bearded old potter, when
the boys explained what they wanted. "Here
it is then," he said, good-naturedly, and gave
them each a lump of the wet clay. Carrying
their treasure carefully the boys hurried back
to Chola's garden.</p>

<p>Shriya was there in a shady nook, swinging
Chola's baby brother gently as he lay in his
cradle. His cradle was a kind of little hammock,
swung between two bamboo supports,
and, as Shriya swayed it gently backward and
forward, she was singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Here is a handful of white rice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here is a bit of sweet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here is a tamarind ripe and nice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A curry for thee and me."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"The little one is fretful. He is not well;
and it may be that he has a fever, the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fears," said Shriya, stopping her song as the
boys came up.</p>

<p>"I will make him a horse to play with,"
and Chola seated himself and began to mould
the clay as he had seen the old potter do.</p>

<p>"I shall make a buffalo like the sacred one
that stole the sweets yesterday," said Nao,
falling to work.</p>

<p>"Tush! this only sticks to my fingers!"
exclaimed Mahala, impatiently, after a few
minutes' work.</p>

<p>"Give it to me and let me try," said Shriya,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Thou canst take it; and a good riddance,
too," and Mahala held out a pair of dirty
hands.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Chola, "here is thy horse,
little one; but wait, I must put a saddle on
him," he said, as the baby crowed and put out
his hands.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"A horse, indeed," laughed Mahala; "it
looks as much like a horse as Nao's buffalo."</p>

<p>"I couldn't make the horns stick on mine,"
grumbled Nao.</p>

<p>"And thou hast forgotten thy buffalo's tail,
too!" Chola laughed, heartily.</p>

<p>"But, look," he continued, "Shriya's are
the best of all."</p>

<p>Shriya's nimble little fingers had indeed
made the two little dolls which she had
moulded look very lifelike.</p>

<p>"I shall put a bit of real cloth on their
heads for veils," she said.</p>

<p>"We will put them here in the sun to dry,"
said Chola, admiring his horse as he held it
up.</p>

<p>"Ah, and if we leave them here, perhaps
'Sir Banas' will come to the garden to-night
and make them all alive," whispered little
Shriya, mysteriously.</p>

<p>The children believed that there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
strange being who came during the night and
made their dolls walk and talk as if they were
alive.</p>

<p>Later on all the family went to the big
square near by, where games were going on;
and everybody took a ride on the big "merry-go-round,"
which was very much like the ones
we have. Shriya's father put her up into one
of the swinging seats, all red and gold, and
took his seat in another, for the grown people
were as fond of riding in a merry-go-round
as the children. The boys were already holding
on tight, each in one of the funny little
swings; and away they went, the long ends
of their turbans flying behind them, until they
were too dizzy to see. But this is the fun of
a merry-go-round the world over. Then they
went home merrily in the warm, dusky twilight,
very happy, with their hands and mouths
sticky with sweetmeats.</p>

<p>One evening, not long after this, as Chola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and Mahala came home from school, Shriya
met them at the garden gate with a very solemn
face.</p>

<p>"See," she whispered to Chola, "the priest
from the temple sits there talking with thy
father. He says the only way to make thy
little brother well is to take him to Benares,
that he may be bathed in the holy river."</p>

<p>All the family were gathered under the big
tamarisk-tree that stood in the centre of the
garden. It was their custom to spread mats
on the brick pavement under the tree and sit
there after the evening meal, the men smoking
their big <i>hookahs</i>, while the women, with their
faces tightly wrapped in long veils, sat a little
back of them gossiping together. As the children
slipped into their places, everybody was
earnestly watching the old Brahmin priest who
sat there, too, looking very fine in his pink
turban and red brocaded silk gown; and also
looking very wise as he drew various sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
curious lines in the dust about him. When
he had finished he looked up and said:</p>

<p>"It is indeed the will of the gods that the
little one be taken to the sacred city."</p>

<p>The Ganges is the most important river in
India, and the Hindus know it as the "Sacred
River." They think that their sins will be
washed away and that they will be cured of
all illness if they will but bathe in its waters
and drink of them.</p>

<p>"It is well said," answered Harajar Chumjeree,
after a long pause. "We will make
the pilgrimage and bathe in the waters of the
holy river; thus will the child be made well
and we shall achieve merit."</p>

<p>Chola's baby brother had not been well for
some weeks. His mother and grandmother
had given him many bitter drinks made from
various healing herbs until he cried and would
take no more of the nasty things, just as children
in our country cry over their medicine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
His mother even dressed him in girl's clothes,
and then charms were brought from the temple
written on pieces of paper, and Lalla, the
baby's mother, soaked the ink off the bits of
paper in water which she gave the baby to
drink. Even this did not make him fat and
rosy. So it was this evening that they came
to decide to make the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>"But first," went on the wise old priest,
"there must be made an offering of money
and a white calf to the gods of the temple."
This would ensure their making the pilgrimage
safely. The Brahmins are very cunning,
however, for they live within the temple and
get the benefits of the offerings which are sent
there.</p>

<p>"Ah, truly, the white calf is not forgotten,"
muttered the old grandmother behind her veil,
but loud enough to be heard. She liked to
doctor her grandchildren herself; and was
rather jealous of the supposed effects of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Brahmin's paper charms. She and the priest
had many hot words as to which of their remedies
was the best.</p>

<p>"Peace!" said her son; "it is right to obey
the gods."</p>

<p>"Shall we go in the 'fire-wagons,' father?"
whispered Chola. He thought the "fire-wagons,"
as they called the railway trains, were
the most wonderful and terrible things in the
world.</p>

<p>"I like not this flying over the ground with
a great noise," answered his father. "But it
will take us quickly and at less cost than if we
travelled by road."</p>

<p>"Indeed I shall not ride in those 'devil-wagons!'"
cried the grandmother, "nor shall the
son of my son" (meaning her grandson).
"Do you wish him to die before he can bathe
in the holy river?"</p>

<p>"In my young days there were none of
these fire-spitting things rushing all over our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
country," she continued, throwing back her
veil in her excitement; "people were content
to ride in their wagons and palanquins."</p>

<p>Harajar Chumjeree was easy-going, and the
mother cared only to start as soon as might
be; so the old lady had her own way, and
it was settled that they should travel in the
big, slow-moving ox-wagon, while she should
be carried in her own special palanquin.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHILDREN TRAVEL IN THE BIG OX-WAGON</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day everybody in the house began
to make preparations for the journey. Not
that they hurried about it as we do. No, indeed!
Everything was done very leisurely,
though there was a lot of talking and disputing
and the giving of contrary orders. At
last, however, the great "<i>ruth wagon</i>" drawn
by oxen, was ready in the courtyard. It was
a heavy and ungainly vehicle with <i>solid</i> wooden
wheels and a canopy closed in with lattice-work
and curtains.</p>

<p>The old porter was there, directing and
scolding the servants as they piled the rugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and blankets and bags of food and pots and
pans and dishes into the wagon. Chola's
father and mother had to take all these things
with them on the journey because there are
no hotels at which they might stay, only camping-places,
or "<i>paraos</i>" beside the roads,
where the traveller could buy his food if need
be and camp for the night.</p>

<p>It was a wonder there was any room left
for the people, but they were all finally stowed
away; except Mahala's father, who was to
take Harajar's place at the shop in the Bazaar
while he was away, and the many cousins who
were left behind to look after the house.</p>

<p>There was quite a procession when at last
the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway.</p>

<p>Behind it came the grandmother, in her
"<i>dhoolie-dak</i>," a sort of a litter, or easy-chair,
swung between two long poles. This was carried
by two men, one in front and one behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
who rested the end of the poles on their shoulders.</p>

<p>Besides the family there were many servants,
and several others walked beside the slow-moving
wagon. The cook, too, went with
them.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" shouted little Nao from his
garden wall as they went by.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" called out Chola and Mahala
to him, from their seats in front beside the
driver. The boys were perfectly happy to think
of all the new, strange sights they were going
to see along the road. They shouted greetings
to their friend the potter as they passed him,
and also to the old "<i>fakir</i>," smeared all over
with ashes, who sat in a little brick hut by the
bridge and pretended to make wonderful cures.</p>

<p>"This is more fun than going to school,"
said Chola, as the oxen plodded along through
clouds of dust. The young folks did not mind
this, however, for the road was very lively with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
people going into the city, some in bullock-carts,
some in big wagons like their own, and
there were many on foot carrying big baskets
on their heads, while beside them trudged little
solemn-faced, dark-skinned children.</p>

<p>At noontime they halted for a rest near an
orchard full of flowering fruit-trees, where
some beautiful peacocks were sunning themselves
on the garden walls, spreading out their
great tails and strutting about. These lovely
birds are found nearly everywhere in India,
and in some parts run quite wild.</p>

<p>"There is a 'Holy Man,'" said Mahala,
pointing to a man who was sitting cross-legged
by the roadside, with only a cloth wrapped
around his waist. His long matted hair hung
on his shoulders, and he was saying his prayers
with the help of a rosary of beads which he
continually passed through his hands.</p>

<p>As the wagon came up, a young man who
accompanied the "Holy Man" ran up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
held out a begging-bowl, saying: "Give, oh,
charitable people, to this Holy One." Chola's
mother threw some cakes into the bowl as the
wagon stopped.</p>

<p>"We will become beggars ourselves before
we reach the 'Sacred City' if we are going
to give to every beggar on the road," grumbled
Harajar. "They are as thick as flies in
our country."</p>

<p>"It is good to give to a 'Holy Man,'" said
the gentle mother. "Maybe he will pray that
our babe be made well;" and she sighed as
she looked down at the white face of the baby
in her arms.</p>

<p>No country in the world has so many beggars
as India. Many of them are called
"Holy Men" because they do nothing but
make pilgrimages from one sacred place to
another, living solely on the alms that are
given to them.</p>

<p>When they had eaten their lunch, the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
people went to explore the garden near them.
"Perhaps there are dogs," said Mahala, a
little fearfully, but they forgot about dogs
when they saw a thicket of sugar-cane down
by a stream. "Perhaps we can buy some from
the man; there he is now ploughing by the
stream," said Chola.</p>

<p>"I will give you some of the sweet cane,
my little princelings," said the man, "if you
will give a wreath of flowers to the Sacred
River for me," when he learned that the boys
were on their way to Benares.</p>

<p>The farmer stopped his oxen in the shade,&mdash;for
oxen also do all the ploughing,&mdash;and
began to cut some of the long purple stalks of
cane. All at once Mahala cried out, and
pulled Chola back, and there, just at their feet,
was a pure white snake crawling out from the
roots of the cane. It flattened out its head
in a most astonishing fashion when it saw
them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" width="360" height="550" alt="Riding an elephant" />
<span class="caption">&quot;FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Behold! a pure white cobra," cried the
farmer. "It must mean good luck to you, my
young masters. It is a rare sight now-a-days
to see one of these white cobras."</p>

<p>The children <i>salaamed</i> to it very politely,
though they were careful to keep at a good
distance. "It is looking for water," said the
farmer, as he took a long stalk of cane and
gently guided it down to the stream. The
snake is another sacred animal of the Hindus,
and they would not kill or injure one for anything.</p>

<p>"It may be a sign that the babe will be
healed," said the mother, hopefully, when the
children came back with their sugar-cane and
told about the wonderful cobra. As they were
about to move on again, they saw a great
cloud of dust down the road. "It is an elephant
and many men," said one of the servants.
"A great ruler, doubtless," said another,
as there came into sight a man on horseback<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
carrying a silk banner or flag. It turned
out that it <i>was</i> a great and powerful Rajah
going in state on a journey to visit another
Rajah, or ruler, of one of the small kingdoms
or states of which modern India was formerly
made up. And did he not look imposing!</p>

<p>First there came a big elephant, all decorated
with silk and gold and silver. On the
elephant's back was a "<i>howdah</i>," which is
like a big chair with a canopy over it, and
in this, sitting cross-legged, was the Rajah,&mdash;a
big, fat fellow dressed in coloured silks and
jewels, with a great diamond-set plume in his
turban. The fittings of this "<i>howdah</i>" were
most luxurious. It was lined and carpeted
with expensive silken rugs, for the making of
which certain <i>castes</i> are famous. There are
many kinds of rugs in India; but those of
woven silk, like the praying-rugs of the temples,
and those upon which the great Rajahs
sit in state, are the most beautiful and expensive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
These rug-makers are mostly Mohammedans,
a religious sect entirely different from
the Hindus.</p>

<p>Behind the "<i>howdah</i>" stood a servant holding
a big umbrella of fine feathers over the
Rajah's head. The driver sat on the neck
of the elephant and guided the big beast by
prodding him on one side or the other with
an iron-shod stick or goad.</p>

<p>After the Rajah, followed many men on
horseback, all in fine dress and carrying lances
and banners of silk; then a whole troop of
servants who guarded the wagons filled with
the Rajah's baggage and the presents he was
carrying to the other Rajah.</p>

<p>"Isn't it fine to ride like that on a big elephant!"
whispered Mahala to Chola, as the
children picked flowers by the roadside and
threw them before the Rajah's elephant, which
is a pretty way the Hindus have of welcoming
a person of importance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"How happy the Rajah must be," said little
Shriya, "to be able to ride like that and wear
such beautiful jewels!" And all the rest of
the day the little folk talked of nothing but
the great Rajah and his escort.</p>

<p>At sunset they came to a <i>parao</i>, where they
were to camp for the night. It was only a
bare piece of ground under some trees, and a
few stalls or little shops where one could buy
food and fuel to make a fire.</p>

<p>Our party came to a halt among many other
bullock-carts, the owners of which were already
sitting around on the ground cooking
their suppers or bargaining for food at the
little booths. Soon, when their own pots and
pans were got out, and the dishes and the bags
of rice and meal, the cook made ready the
supper.</p>

<p>"This is much more fun than eating at
home," said Shriya, as the children were gathering
big leaves from the trees. These they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
used for plates, heaping them up with their
boiled rice, and curry, and fish, and all sorts
of puddings and sweets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the oxen tethered close by were
eating their suppers of chopped straw. As
supper was being eaten, another party stopped
at the <i>parao</i> and camped not far away. There
were many servants in the new party, and a
fine litter with gold and silk coverings. When
the litter was put down, a young boy stepped
out, looking very proud and haughty. His
servants at once spread a handsome rug on
the ground for him to sit on and rushed about
waiting on him, taking good care to keep
every one at a distance.</p>

<p>"It is a noble Brahmin boy, and he must
be a little prince at the very least," whispered
Mahala to Chola in an awestruck voice. "See
his rich dresses and the airs he puts on."</p>

<p>"Yes, and how he orders every one about
him. Nothing seems good enough for him,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
replied Chola; "but he has a right to be
proud, for he wears the 'Sacred Thread'
about him," he continued, looking at the little
boy with interest. Around the little Brahmin's
neck was a thin cord or thread, which was the
sign of his high <i>caste</i>.</p>

<p>Just then a little boy from one of the wagons
crept up near and <i>salaamed</i> before him
until his head touched the ground.</p>

<p>"Away! do not come so near my master,"
cried one of the servants, and ordered him off.</p>

<p>"Ha! the servant is right," said the children's
grandmother, who was sitting in her
palanquin-litter enjoying the lively scene.
"When I was young like Shriya, a beggar
boy like that would not have dared come so
near a noble child." The old woman frowned
at the little boy, who crept meekly back to his
cart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the haughty little Brahmin ate
his supper, with his head turned away so no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
one could see him eat, and then, growing tired
of respectful glances of the crowd around him,
he got into his litter again and the servants
fastened the curtains tightly around him.</p>

<p>Chola and Mahala were sleepy by this time,
so they just rolled themselves up in quilts on
the ground, while Shriya crept into the wagon
with her mother. Everybody slept soundly,
in spite of the fact that one of the servants was
beating a drum most of the night, which they
really believed was the way to keep off evil
spirits.</p>

<p>The first thing Chola heard when he woke
up the next morning was the cook scolding the
doves, who were picking out of his meal bags
while he was getting breakfast ready.</p>

<p>"Oh, the thieves!" he cried. "They are
as bad as the beggars."</p>

<p>"They are hungry," said Chola. "It would
not please thee to be scolded if thou wert
hungry." Then he and Mahala amused themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by throwing pieces of cake to the doves
who were picking up their food around the
carts, and the green paroquets which came flying
out of the trees, where they had been
roosting all the night.</p>

<p>They did not see the little Brahmin again.
The curtains of his litter were still tightly
closed when, after much shouting and running
about, the bullocks were at last yoked into
the wagon and the little procession rolled away
down the dusty road long before the sun came
up over the distant groves of mango-trees.</p>

<p>"What art thou guarding so carefully,
Shriya?" asked her brother. He and Chola
were walking beside the wagon for a change.
The lattices were raised so Shriya and her
mother and aunt could enjoy the fresh air.</p>

<p>"They are my dolls," said the little girl,
sadly, as she patted the bundle beside her. "I
take them as an offering to the holy river."</p>

<p>"Poor little woman! Must thou sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
thy toys, too?" smiled her uncle as he patted
her head.</p>

<p>"It is right that she should," answered her
mother; for she, too, had thrown her dolls
into the sacred river when she was a child,
at the yearly festival, when the children must
sacrifice their playthings to the great river.</p>

<p>The boys suddenly looked gloomy, for they
remembered that the day would come only too
soon when they, too, would have to destroy
all their toys. Chola wondered to himself as
he walked along if he might not at least save
the little tiger, painted a bright yellow with
red spots, which was his favourite toy.</p>

<p>But the children could not be sad long, with
so much going on about them, and they were
soon shouting and laughing to a group of children
by the roadside who were amusing themselves
playing at making "graves." They
were heaping up little mounds of dust and
sticking flowers in them, which is the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thing little Hindu children have to "mud
pies."</p>

<p>For several days our little party plodded
along the flat, dusty road, camping out at
night at the <i>paraos</i>, until at last they drew
near the "Holy City of Benares."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHILDREN SEE BENARES AND GO HOME
FOR A WEDDING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the road to Benares they found many
other people going the same way as they themselves.
There were old people, young people,
children, beggars of all kinds, priests of all
faiths, sick people and well people,&mdash;all going
to the "Holy City" carrying offerings of
flowers and fruits, and all intending to bathe
in the Sacred River.</p>

<p>Finally our party made camp just outside
the city gates. Here they left the wagon and
servants and made their way through the
crowded, dirty streets until they finally came
down to the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

<p>Such a sight as met their eyes!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" said Chola, "all the temples in
the world must be here."</p>

<p>"And all the people, too," said Mahala.</p>

<p>"And all the beggars as well," answered
Harajar, as they shouldered their way through
a crowd of "<i>fakirs</i>" holding out their begging-bowls.</p>

<p>"Nay, speak kindly of all in the 'Holy
City.' It may be that our child will be cured,"
said the gentle mother, as she wrapped her veil
around the baby to keep off the hot sun.</p>

<p>The children stopped to stare at the hundreds
of big temples of strange shapes which
stretched up and down the river back as far
as they could see. In front of these temples
were terraces and long flights of steps, called
"<i>ghats</i>" leading down to the river's edge.</p>

<p>"We will go first to the temple to make
an offering," said Chola's father, as they
walked past temple after temple full of queer,
ugly images.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="364" height="550" alt="children making wreaths" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THESE THE CHILDREN TWISTED INTO WREATHS AND THREW INTO THE RIVER.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>At last, after many inquiries, they found the
temple that they were looking for, and put
dishes of coloured rice and flowers before a
great bronze image with four arms and two
big diamonds for eyes, sitting cross-legged just
as they did themselves.</p>

<p>After this they went down the long steps in
front of the temple to the river's bank, and
the baby was bathed in the water with much
ceremony.</p>

<p>The children all splashed around and thought
it rather good fun. The water was cool and
agreeable, and they amused themselves trying
to catch the long lines of flower wreaths which
went floating by. These wreaths of flowers
are thrown into the waters of the Ganges by
the pilgrims as an offering to the waters of
the "Sacred River."</p>

<p>Little Shriya had brought her dolls. One
by one she sadly dropped them, the brightly
painted little dolls, made of clay and dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
just like herself, into the river. At last she
held in her arms only the two she had made
herself in the garden at home. They had lost
most of their arms and legs on the journey,
and were sorry-looking little dolls; but Shriya
was very fond of them, and she wondered if
the "Sacred River" would really miss them
if she kept them. With a sigh she decided this
would be very wrong, and so she put them,
too, tenderly in the water among the floating
flowers. She then sat down on the steps and
drew her veil over her face and sighed softly,
for it would be three whole months before she
could have any more dolls.</p>

<p>"Here are our flowers," said Chola, running
down the steps with his arms full of yellow
marigolds and sweet jasmine, which he had
bought from the flower-seller who sat under
one of the big umbrellas. These the children
twisted into wreaths and threw into the river.
"And here is one for the man who gave us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the sugar-cane," he said, tossing a large wreath
on the water.</p>

<p>"Here thou wilt see every <i>caste</i> in India,"
said Harajar, as they sat on the steps drying
themselves under a big umbrella after their
bath. There were indeed thousands of people;
some just getting ready to enter the water;
others slipping into their dry clothes after their
bath. There were water-carriers, carrying
great jugs of the "holy water" to sell to
pilgrims to carry with them.</p>

<p>"Look how the smoke rolls up yonder," said
Mahala. "The smoke comes from the burning
'<i>ghats</i>.' May the little one not have to
be carried there," said his uncle, looking gloomily
at the smoke curling up from the edge of
the river lower down.</p>

<p>"Nay, speak not of them. 'Tis an evil
omen and the gods may hear thee," said the
mother, as she held the baby closer to her.</p>

<p>It is the Hindu custom to burn their dead;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and, in spite of bathing and drinking the
sacred water, many of the poor pilgrims do
die at Benares. Indeed, it may be that they
die because they do drink it; for you can
imagine how dirty the river is with so many,
many thousands of people bathing in it all the
time. For this reason certain of the "<i>ghats</i>"
along the river are set apart as places where
bodies may be burned. The bodies are laid
on great piles of wood which are set on fire,
the families of the dead sitting around lamenting
and wailing.</p>

<p>Our party camped some days outside the
great gate and took many baths and drank
much water. When they finally got home
again, everybody was very happy, for the baby
was really much better.</p>

<p>"We did well to go," said Chola's father,
as he looked at the baby growing fat and well
again.</p>

<p>"I think the white cobra helped to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
us good luck, too," Chola said, confidentially
to Mahala.</p>

<p>Then word came from the boys' Uncle
Achmed that he was coming to the city to take
a new elephant back home with him, and that
they might go back with him for a visit.</p>

<p>Little Shriya soon forgot to grieve for her
lost dolls, for now the grand preparations for
her wedding began. It is the custom for our
little Hindu cousins to marry very young.
But this is only a ceremony. As little Shriya
was only nine years old, she would still stay
at home and play with her toys until she was
grown up, when she would go and live in her
husband's family.</p>

<p>If, meanwhile, her boy husband should die
and leave her a widow, she would have to go
into mourning for him all her life and never
marry again. She would have to shave her
head and never wear any more pretty, bright
dresses or jewels, and only eat one meal a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Then, too, everybody would have as little to
do with her as possible; for even to <i>see</i> a
widow is thought to be bad luck. You see
that some of the Hindu customs are very unjust
to the little Hindu girls. So it was no
wonder that Shriya did not want to keep the
festival of the Goddess of Learning, for fear
it might cause her to be a widow some day.</p>

<p>On the day of the wedding, Shriya stood in
the middle of the big room of the <i>zenana</i>,
being dressed for the grand ceremony. How
happy and excited she was! To-day, for the
first time in her life, she was the most important
person in the family. She had been bathed
with sweet perfumes, and her mother had put
all kinds of powders on her face and painted
her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, is it not lovely?" cried the
little girl gleefully, as the mother draped a
scarf of pale blue silk all shining with gold
over her beautiful dress of pink silk.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now thou wilt indeed look like a little
princess," said the grandmother, as she put a
wonderful jewelled head-dress which she had
worn at her own wedding on Shriya's head.
It was of gold set with many jewels, and little
Shriya gave a sigh of pleasure and joyfully
clapped her hands when her mother held up
a small mirror that she might see herself.</p>

<p>The grandmother decked her out with many
other kinds of jewelled ornaments, long earrings
that hung down to her shoulders, beautiful
pearls, and a gold collar around her neck.
Then she put on bracelet after bracelet of gold
and silver until her arms were almost covered
from shoulder to wrist, and she had to hold
them stiff like a doll. And her fingers were
so covered with rings that she could hardly
move them at all. Last of all the grandmother
threw over her a long veil of silk tissue, spangled
with gold.</p>

<p>What would you think of a little girl dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in all these beautiful things and being barefooted?
Shriya would much rather have rings
on her toes than shoes and stockings. She <i>did</i>
have rings on her toes, too, and silver bands
on her ankles as well.</p>

<p>The last thing the grandmother did was to
hang wreaths of jasmine flowers all over her.
It was no wonder that she had to be pushed
along by some one! She could not possibly
have walked by herself.</p>

<p>How pleased little Shriya was! Everybody
was admiring her and giving her good wishes.
The boys were quite jealous, for they felt that
every one was paying more attention to a girl
than to either of them.</p>

<p>"Next year I shall be married, too," said
Chola, trying to console himself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 370px;">

<span class="caption">THE MARRIAGE OF SHRIYA.</span>
</div>

<p>But just then some one called out that the
bridegroom was coming, and all the children
ran out to meet him. The little bridegroom
rode a spirited pony, and looked as fine as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
little Rajah in his white silk dress with golden
flowers embroidered all over it, and in front
of his turban a handsome jewelled ornament.
He had shoes on, and around his neck were
chains of jewels and precious stones. Behind
him came a long procession of relatives and
friends. When he got to the door, all the
little girls, Shriya's little friends, surrounded
him and led him into the courtyard. Chola
and Mahala were very busy running around
giving each guest a wreath of jasmine to hang
around their necks, and a wand of sandalwood,
which was lighted like a candle and gave off
a sweet perfume as it burned.</p>

<p>A beautiful arbour of flowers had been put
up in the inner courtyard, under which the
bride and groom sat side by side.</p>

<p>The old Brahmin priest was there, of course,
to perform the marriage ceremony. He made
a <i>salaam</i> to the north and south and the east
and the west, a sign of politeness to the "good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
spirits" who were supposed to be present;
and, after many long prayers, the grandmother
put a silver cord around the bride's neck, after
which the guests threw handfuls of rice which
they took from a great copper bowl before the
bridal couple.</p>

<p>Just as all the little girls were marching
around the courtyard after the ceremony, followed
by the bride and groom, what should
naughty Jam, the pet monkey, do but snatch
some of the rice out of the bowl, and rush with
it to the roof, where he sat chattering and
throwing it down on the heads of the guests.
This greatly amused the children; but the old
Brahmin was very angry. So Chola had to
pretend to scold the little monkey:</p>

<p>"Thou shalt come down and taste the bamboo
rod, naughty one!" he cried, looking up
at his pet. But Jam only chattered the harder
and threw more rice and made up his mind to
stay where he was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis a good saying of ours&mdash;'Never trust
a boy or a monkey.' Eh, Chola?" said his
Uncle Achmed, who had just got there in time
for the wedding, laughing.</p>

<p>But Jam was quite forgotten when a great
beating of drums was heard outside and in
came the dancing-girls and the musicians.</p>

<p>All the company then sat around the court
and watched the <i>nautch-girls</i>, as they are called,
dance. They never thought of dancing themselves,
deeming it too much work. All the
time the musicians were beating their drums
and playing on the funniest sorts of instruments
imaginable, like queer-shaped mandolins
and zithers; and it was more like a screechy
noise than like music&mdash;just a monotonous
singsong chant.</p>

<p>But this was not the end of the gaieties.
There were many dinners to be given. So the
cook-room was in a perfect hubbub, and you
may believe that the grandmother was making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
everybody fly around. But she found time to
scold the crowd of beggars who were hanging
around the doors however, though at the same
time she saw to it that they got the scraps that
were left.</p>

<p>"It is well to be good to the poor at all
times," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah, but this is the best thing of all!"
exclaimed Chola to Mahala, as he and his
cousin and Nao sat side by side on a mat in
the pretty garden that evening and saw the
wonderful fireworks. There were queer animals
and birds, all made up with coloured
lamps and fires; and all through the trees were
hung lanterns, made of big yellow gourds with
coloured lights inside them. All the while the
musicians thumped on their drums, and everybody
was very gay and merry.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LITTLE SAHIB SEES THE BIG ELEPHANTS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">To-day</span> I must take the young elephants
home," said Uncle Achmed, when the wedding
festivities were over. "Are the two little
princelings ready to go with me?" he continued,
smiling at his two little nephews.</p>

<p>"Indeed we are," exclaimed the two boys,
wild with delight, though they did not whoop
or jump about as boys probably would do elsewhere.
Little Hindu children don't make
much noise at any time. It would be thought
strange because it would be bad manners to
do so; indeed a Hindu very seldom even
laughs loudly.</p>

<p>But there was nothing that Chola and Mahala
really liked better than to go to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
uncle's house and see the big elephants at work.
Uncle Achmed had a big lumber-yard on the
banks of the Ganges, and used many elephants
to move about and pile up the great logs of
teak-wood. Wouldn't little boys in America
think it a lot of fun if they could go out into
the country and see, instead of horses, a lot
of elephants at work? Well, that is just what
a little Hindu boy can do, for elephants are
almost as plentiful as horses in India; and
they use them for many kinds of work where
we use horses or machinery.</p>

<p>"I have brought the old elephant with me;
he is wise and will be able to show the others
the way home; and, also, he will tell them
how to behave," said Achmed, as he and the
two boys made their way to the <i>serai</i>, the
camping-place of the elephants outside the city
gate.</p>

<p>Here were lots and lots of great gray elephants,
swinging their long trunks from side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to side as they swayed and stamped around,
while their owners and drivers shouted and disputed
together.</p>

<p>The two young elephants were hobbled in
one corner, swaying to and fro and swinging
their trunks in rather a wicked way. Near by
was Uncle Achmed's old elephant, swinging
his trunk at the two young ones as much as to
say: "There are a great many things for you
youngsters to learn yet, and I'm going to teach
you."</p>

<p>The driver touched the old elephant with
his stick and the great beast slowly knelt down.
Achmed and the boys then climbed into the
<i>howdah</i>, and the great big elephant marched
off with much dignity.</p>

<p>"Look, the little elephants do not like the
road," said Chola, pointing to the new elephants,
who would not budge. A little prodding
from the driver's sharp stick, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
made them change their minds quickly; and
they meekly followed the old elephant.</p>

<p>"Thou art like two little Rajahs now," said
Uncle Achmed, with a smile as he squatted
in the <i>howdah</i> beside them and took out his
"<i>betel</i>" box. It was a beautiful little silver
box, all inlaid with enamel and precious stones.
Inside were three compartments which held
<i>betel</i> nuts, lime, and spices. He took a pinch
of all three of these and began to chew the
<i>pan</i>, as the mixture is called.</p>

<p>The boys had a very good time. They
would call down to the children walking along
the dusty road and twit them for not being
able to ride in state as they were doing, just
as children do the world over. Everybody
gave them the road, or, rather, the big elephants
took it as a matter of course. The old
elephant took all kinds of liberties with the
passers-by, evidently just for the fun of the
thing. He would give a fellow trudging along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a nudge on the back with the end of his trunk,
which would nearly scare the fellow to death;
or he would sneeze, as it were, into a lazy
beggar's face, which would make the "Holy
Man" very angry indeed. Once he deliberately
took a nice ripe melon out of a cart
and ate it, while its owner, who was fast
asleep, never missed it.</p>

<p>"He is a wise one," said Uncle Achmed,
"but what is the matter there?" he cried,
looking back. The matter was that a wedding
procession had just come out of a side road.
The bride was in a litter covered with gay
curtains and gold embroideries, and the bridegroom
was riding a white horse which was all
decked with flowers, and had his mane and tail
dyed pink.</p>

<p>With all this splendour there was much
beating of drums and music from other noisy
instruments. One of the new elephants had
taken a great fright and backed up against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
bride's litter. This had made the bridegroom's
horse rear up and nearly upset him on the
dusty road. The poor little bride screamed,
and the crowd of relations and friends abused
the elephant and all his family and kindred
back through many generations, several hundreds
of years, which is the true Hindu fashion
of showing one's anger.</p>

<p>The drivers prodded and punched, but the
young elephant would not move. Then old
Ranji, the wise old elephant, wheeled around
and went up to the naughty and obstinate
youngster and gave his trunk such a twist that
he squealed out in pain. Then Ranji gave him
a push out into the middle of the road again,
and after this kept the young one right in
front of him. He was so scared that he
scarcely dared to swing his trunk from side
to side again; and all went smoothly until
they lumbered into the great courtyard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Achmed's house, which sat in the midst of a
wide expanse of rice-fields.</p>

<p>As they climbed down out of the "<i>howdah</i>,"
the head servant made a "<i>salaam</i>," or
bow, before the master until his forehead
touched the ground, which is a way of being
very polite. He then told Achmed that the
Colonel <i>Sahib</i> and the little <i>Sahib</i> had done
him the honour of coming to see him, and
were even now sitting in the garden awaiting
his coming. All Englishmen in India are
called <i>Sahib</i> and English women are called
<i>Mem-sahib</i>.</p>

<p>Achmed found the Colonel sitting on a bed
under a big tree in the garden. This bed the
head servant had brought from the house for
him to sit on, for this is one of the forms
of politeness shown to English visitors at a
Hindu home.</p>

<p>Just then the "little <i>Sahib</i>" ran up to see
the elephants; and, who should he be, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
little boy who had lost his way in the Bazaar.</p>

<p>"Look, it is the little <i>Sahib</i> I talked with,"
exclaimed Chola to Mahala.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Harry, holding out his hand.
"Oh, I forgot you folk never shake hands,"
he continued. "Isn't it funny to think I
should see you again? But this isn't the same
boy who was with you before," he continued,
turning to Mahala.</p>

<p>The boys were delighted to see each other
again, and soon were talking away as if they
had always known one another, though sometimes
it was hard for them to understand, and
they made many funny mistakes.</p>

<p>Harry thought the big elephants were wonderful
beasts, and wanted to see them at work;
so the boys took him down to the river where
the elephants were piling up the teak. An
elephant picks up one end of a log with his
trunk and lays that on the pile; then he takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
hold of the other end and so brings it around
in place. All the while his driver sits on the
neck of the great beast, and tells him what
to do by prodding him gently with his iron-shod
stick. After awhile the elephants become
so well trained that they will do their work
without any guidance whatever.</p>

<p>Harry was amazed. He had never seen
elephants at work before; but it was an old
story to the Hindu boys, and they told him
how the elephants were made to help build
roads and railroads, and even carry cannon on
their backs in battle. Elephants are very intelligent,
and can be trained to do the most
wonderful things.</p>

<p>"We will go now and see the wonderful
elephant of old Yusuf," said Chola, leading
the way to the back of the house, where old
Yusuf, the head driver, lived. Here they saw
the funniest sight. Yusuf's baby grandson lay
asleep on a mat in front of the door, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
old elephant was standing by waving his trunk
backwards and forwards over the baby to keep
away the flies.</p>

<p>How the children laughed! "That is the
funniest '<i>ayah</i>' I have ever seen," said Harry.
An "<i>ayah</i>" is the name for the Indian nursemaids.</p>

<p>Old Yusuf now came up and showed them
how the elephant would wake up the <i>coolies</i>,
or labourers, when they were sleeping in the
shade, by filling his trunk with water and
squirting it over the sleeping fellows. When
he wanted his master he would go to the door
of his house and knock against it with his
foot, just as a person would knock with his
fist, only a good deal harder.</p>

<p>"Yusuf knows, too, the language that the
elephants talk together in the jungle," whispered
Chola to Harry. It really seemed as
if the old man did understand the language of
the elephants, for he would speak to the elephant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with strange sounds, and the beast
would follow him about like a dog. "He has
taught me to speak some of the elephant talk,
also," continued Chola, looking very knowing.</p>

<p>Harry told the boys that his father had
come to talk with Achmed about a tiger hunt
that he and several other Englishmen, who
were friends of his, were planning. Achmed
was well known as a good man to plan a hunt,
for he knew the jungle well, as the wild forests
of India are called.</p>

<p>"Papa is going to take me on the tiger
hunt, too. Won't that be fine!" said Harry,
eagerly. "Mamma was afraid at first, but I
begged as hard as I knew, and told her that
if I was going to be in the Indian Survey some
day, I'd have to go through the jungle grass
and wild forests, and take measurements with
all sorts of instruments and things, and that
I might as well get acquainted with the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
now. Then papa laughed and said that I
ought to begin as soon as possible, and so it
is all fixed.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you both come, too?"
Harry asked the boys. "Your uncle could
bring you. Wouldn't it be fun! Perhaps we
could shoot a tiger ourselves!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't dare to even think of
attacking a tiger," gasped the gentle little
Chola. Hindus are as a rule mild, gentle
folk. Perhaps this comes from their laws, so
commonly observed, which forbid them to kill
animals or eat meat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are afraid to go," said Harry.</p>

<p>"I have not fear, though I would not be
brave enough to attempt to kill a great tiger;
but I should like to go all the same. We
are brave people, and many of our warrior
<i>caste</i> serve in the great Sahib's army, as you
know," said Chola, proudly.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to say that. I know you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
people are brave. Father often says he never
had a finer lot of soldiers than those in his
Indian regiment," replied Harry, hurriedly.
He was afraid that he had hurt the little
Hindu boy's feelings.</p>

<p>"But perhaps you can go, Chola, if Mahala
can't. Let us go now and ask your uncle if
he will take you," continued Harry.</p>

<p>"By all means let the boy come, Achmed.
He will be a companion for you, Harry," said
the Colonel <i>Sahib</i>. "And he will help you
learn Hindustanee, too. You need help, do
you not?" laughed his father.</p>

<p>"What will your father say if the gods of
the jungle carry you off?" asked Achmed,
half-banteringly. But he could not long refuse
his favourite nephew anything that he
could give him, and so it was arranged that
Achmed, with two of his best drivers, and
Chola, should meet the Colonel Sahib and his
party at the big railway station in Lucknow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in a week's time. From there they would take
the "fire-wagons" to a certain small village,
from which they would make their real start
for the jungle.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CHOLA GOES ON A TIGER HUNT</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Mahala felt very badly as he stood in
the big railway station and watched Chola
and the little Sahib go off in the fire-carriage.
"I will go and buy some sweetmeats," he said
finally. This made him feel a little better,
for Mahala had a very "sweet tooth."</p>

<p>Meantime Chola and his little friend were
speeding quickly through waving rice-fields and
grain-fields. This is even more fun than travelling
in the ox-wagon, thought Chola, as they
rushed through town after town and watched
the trees fly past. Finally they stopped at the
village where Achmed had arranged for the
elephants and the beaters to meet them, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the real way to hunt tigers is to go after them
on elephants.</p>

<p>The servants had packed away their belongings
and camp things on top of the two big
elephants, as they expected to have to live in
the jungle for several days.</p>

<p>"Isn't this splendid?" exclaimed Harry, as
the elephants went rocking along through the
tangled grass. He was so excited that he
could not keep still, and even Chola's mild
black eyes were sparkling.</p>

<p>The beaters, whose business it is to beat
through the long grass and underbrush where
a tiger might be hidden, were full of tales of
a great man-eating tiger that was the terror
of the region, and who was in the habit of
coming boldly up to the fields and gardens,
carrying off goats and even attacking the oxen.</p>

<p>When they came to one of the little villages,
they found the inhabitants in a state of terror.
Only the day before, the tiger had sprung on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a farmer who was ploughing his fields and
carried him off in sight of the whole village.
The tracks which were seen in the mud along
the banks of a stream showed that he was a
very big and powerful tiger.</p>

<p>Our party followed these tracks for some
time, but nothing more was discovered; and,
as it was growing late, they made camp for
the night.</p>

<p>The servants quickly put up the tents for
the Sahibs and built a big fire. They did not
want a tiger to pay them a surprise visit at
night; and hungry tigers often do bold things.</p>

<p>"Ough! this is creepy. Just suppose a
tiger should steal up behind us now," confided
Harry to Chola, as they sat around the big
fire after supper.</p>

<p>"It is well to have a charm; hast thou
one?" asked little Chola, as he felt for the
charm which hung about his neck. He always
wore a charm, but this was one which his uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
had given him to keep off the evil spirits of
the jungle.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," laughed Harry. "We don't
wear such things. Still, if one does believe
in charms, now is the time to have one," he
added, looking behind him rather fearfully.</p>

<p>It was strange and wild there in the dense
forest full of unknown dangers; and there
were queer noises, and the firelight twisted
up the shadows of the men and elephants into
grewsome and unsightly things.</p>

<p>Once in awhile a cry would come from some
wild animal or bird in the trees, and the boys
would look over their shoulders and draw up
closer to the fire. But it was fun, although
they felt more creepy still when the beaters
began to tell stories of wonderful hunts in
which they had taken part in the past; and
the old head beater, who had come from the
south, himself, told tales of his wonderful
adventures.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>He told how one night he awoke and found
a leopard sniffing at his head as he lay sleeping
on his veranda; and how he only saved his
life by holding his breath and pretending to be
dead. A leopard will not touch a dead person
or animal. Another time he had seen the
queer little "<i>Todas</i>," a race of people who
live in the Nilgiri Hills in the far south and
worship buffaloes, and say prayers while they
are milking these sacred beasts, whose temples
are their dairies.</p>

<p>He knew, too, the wild, shy people of the
jungle, who build their houses like nests in
the trees, so as to be safe from prowling wild
beasts. Once while hunting in the deep forest
he had been caught in the huge coils of a terrible
boa-constrictor, one of those great snakes
that can crush an ox by winding themselves
about it in great coils, or can swallow an antelope
at one mouthful. The beater was only
saved from the anger of the great snake by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
one of the other hunters coming up just at
the right moment and killing it.</p>

<p>He was a wonderful man, this old fellow
with the long gray beard, as he sat by the fire
chewing his "<i>betel</i>" nut and telling his neverending
stories.</p>

<p>The next morning all were up at daybreak,
for they wanted to get an early start. One of
the elephants had been rather ugly during the
time when the men were packing the things on
his back, and he was still in a bad temper when
Harry came up with a piece of sugar for him.
Instead of putting the sugar into the elephant's
mouth, Harry accidentally dropped it on the
ground. This made the elephant still more
angry; and, as Harry stooped to pick up the
sugar, he lifted his great foot and would have
crushed the boy, who did not dream of the
danger he was in. Suddenly Chola saw the
danger, and rushing right up under the angry
elephant's foot made those strange cries that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the old head driver at his uncle's had taught
him. It was the talk of the elephants among
themselves as they roamed the jungle.</p>

<p>It was like magic. The big foot came down
gently without touching either of the boys,
and the elephant, giving a peculiar cry, rubbed
his trunk against Chola, just as the Colonel
Sahib and every one came running up in terror,
for they had seen it all and thought that the
boys would surely be crushed to death.</p>

<p>Chola was a great hero! You can imagine
how the Colonel Sahib thanked him; and the
natives looked at him with wonder and awe.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/i127.jpg" width="369" height="550" alt="tiger attacking an elephant that people are riding" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SUDDENLY, UP OUT OF THE JUNGLE, THERE SPRANG A GREAT YELLOW TIGER.&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>"He is indeed one who is wise though
young; for the wild animals talk with him
as with a friend," said the old head beater,
as he <i>salaamed</i> down to Chola's feet.</p>

<p>Harry did not say much until he and Chola
were alone, and then he said: "Chola, I <i>did</i>
think you were a bit of a coward when we
were talking in your uncle's garden; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
know now you are much braver than I, for
I would never have dared to go up like that
and order about an angry elephant."</p>



<p>After everybody had got over their fright
and were actually ready to start, some of the
beaters who had been looking around for signs
of tigers came back and said they had seen the
tracks. So everything was got ready as quickly
as possible, or as quickly as Hindus can be
got to move, and the big elephants went trudging
along through the underwood until finally
it was seen that the grass had been crushed
down in places, a sign that the tiger himself
could not be far away. The elephants began
to show signs of fear, as they always do when
a tiger is about, and the beaters divided their
forces, some of them going around one way
and the rest another, searching carefully
through the tangled grass and underbrush.
All the men got their guns ready, and it was
not a minute too soon; for, suddenly, up out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the jungle, there sprang a great yellow
tiger, straight for the "<i>howdah</i>" in which the
Colonel Sahib and Harry and Chola were sitting.</p>

<p>With a howl of pain the tiger rolled under
the elephant's feet, as a bullet from the Colonel's
gun went crashing into his brain.</p>

<p>"My! but he's a fine fellow! Won't his
skin make a fine rug, father?" cried Harry,
in great excitement. When he was measured,
the old beater said that it was one of the biggest
tigers he had ever seen. The Colonel
felt very proud of his prize.</p>

<p>They beat around through the bush for several
days, but they came upon no more tigers;
so the party turned back again on their own
tracks bound for home.</p>

<p>Our two little friends were sorry to part,
but Harry said that Chola must come and see
him at Simla, up in the hills, where the English
folk go when it gets too hot for them to
stay in the plains and in the big cities. There
the boys would have some more "good times"
at the Colonel Sahib's <i>bungalow</i>, among the
cedars, as the Englishman's country house in
India is called.</p>

<p>And didn't Chola have wonderful tales to
tell to Mahala and Nao, as they all sat together
in the evenings under the big tree in
the garden, while Shriya played with her new
dolls beside them and listened with wide-open
eyes.</p>
